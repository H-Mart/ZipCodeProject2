ZipCodeProject2 Instructions

Compiling
Compile with g++ --std=c++17 -Wall -o ZipCode.out *.cpp -lstdc++fs

(-lstdc++fs links the filesystem library and must be at the end of the call to g++)

Running
There are two optional arguments that will change the way the program functions.

  -Z<list_of_zip_codes> where list_of_zip_codes is a comma separated list of zip codes to search the file for
  
  -C<csv_filename> where csv_filename is the name of a csv file of the type used in this project.

The only required argument is a path to a file. 

If -C is used, the program will try to convert the csv file to the lirf format and write it to the lirf path provided.  
If -Z is used, the program will load the file from the path provided and search for the zip codes.  
If both -C and -Z are used, the program will currently act as if only -C was used. (This might change later)

These options can appear in any order after the executable name. 

Examples: 

./ZipCode.out -Z24321,42444 example_file  
will try to open and read a file called example_file and search for the zip codes 24321 and 42444. Any zip codes that are found
in the file will have their entire record printed in a table. The zip codes that are not found will be listed after any that were found.

For example, using these two zip codes on the file provided, the output will look like
----------------------------------------------------------------
Zip       Place NameState  County       Latitude    Longitude
----------------------------------------------------------------
42444     Poole     KY     Webster      37.641      -87.6439
----------------------------------------------------------------


The following zip codes did not match any records in the file:
24321


./ZipCode.out -Cexample_csv_file.csv example_file  
will try to open and read a file called example_csv_file.csv and will create or overwrite a file called example_file with the data read from the csv file. 


./ZipCode.out example_file  
without either optional argument, the program will simply try to read example_file as a file and do nothing.
